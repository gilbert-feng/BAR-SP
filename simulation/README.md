Codes for procuding the simulation in **Shrinkage estimation and inference for network-linked data: a robust spectral embedding approach**.

The folder `functions` includes the codes to generate synthetic data and implement the methods.

The file `sim_total.R` includes the code to produce the numerical results for one-group setting.

The file `sim_total_G.R` includes the code to produce the numerical results for four-group setting.


The file `sim_mse_in sample.R` includes the codes to produce the numerical results to evaluate the in-sample prediction performance.

The file `sim_mse_out sample.R` includes the codes to produce the numerical results to evaluate the out-of-sample prediction performance.

The file `sim_mse_p.R` includes the codes to produce the numerical results under different covariate dimension.

The file `sim_mse_spars.R` includes the codes to produce the numerical results under different model sparsity.

Similarly, we have sim_mse_G files include the codes to produce the numerical results related to the four-group setting.
